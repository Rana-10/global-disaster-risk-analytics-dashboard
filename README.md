🌍 Global Disaster Risk & Resilience Analytics Dashboard
📌 Overview

This project presents an integrated global disaster risk and resilience analytics system using multi-source datasets including:

EM-DAT Disaster Database

World Bank Development Indicators

UNDP Human Development Data

The system combines data engineering, index computation, and interactive visual analytics to evaluate global disaster exposure, vulnerability, and resilience trends from 1960–2022.

⚙️ Tech Stack

Python 3.12
